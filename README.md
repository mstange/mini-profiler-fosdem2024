# mini-profiler-fosdem2024

This is an example project which I built to go along with my FOSDEM presentation [Writing fast JavaScript with Data-Oriented Design](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2773-writing-fast-javascript-with-data-oriented-design/).

[Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yn87uVuB7oXmRX5uMsdu9_DQP7M5a2jO2xKuRl1ERIo/edit?usp=sharing)

It's a SvelteKit project, created by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
